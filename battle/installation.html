			<h2>1. Installing SMBX2</h2>
			<p>
				If you have SMBX2 installed already (and it's the latest version), you can skip this step. This guide just goes over a standard episode installation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Battle Arena runs on an engine called SMBX2, which you'll need to install first. You can download the installer at <a class="link" href="https://codehaus.moe">codehaus.moe</a>. Make sure that you install into a regular folder, rather than something like OneDrive.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Installing Battle Arena</h2>
			<p>
				First, download Battle Arena itself. The download is on the front page. Then, find where you installed SMBX2, and go into its "worlds" folder (or "data/worlds"). Move the zip file for Battle Arena into this folder, and then extract it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, after starting SMBX2, Battle Arena should be recognised in the launcher! You can already start it and play local multiplayer. However, online multiplayer takes a bit more setup, which you can follow the guide below for.
