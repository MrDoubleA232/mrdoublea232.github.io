			<h1>Changelog</h1>

			<h2>v1.2.0 - 2025/06/01</h2>
			<p>

					<img style="width: 50%; margin-right: 2%" class="screenshot" src="assets/screenshots/cyberworld.png" alt="Screenshot of the new Cyber World level">
					<img style="width: 50%; margin-left: 2%" class="screenshot" src="assets/screenshots/costumemenu.png" alt="Screenshot of the new costume menu">
				</div>

				<h3>Additions/Changes</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Costumes are now player-specific rather than applying to all players of the same character.
						<ul>
							<li>As a result of the new costume system, costumes can no longer change the player's hitbox.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Added two new levels: "The Suck" and "CYBER WORLD".</li>
					<!-- <li>Added Hell Maps. Good luck!</li> -->
					<li>Added <span><img src="assets/hellmaps.gif" alt="hell maps" height=24></span>. Good luck!</li>
					<li>Added a menu for changing costumes.</li>
					<li>The minimap is more detailed, now showing the terrain of the level.</li>
					<li>Extra information is now displayed on the loading screen before a game.</li>
					<li>Added a countdown during the last 10 seconds.</li>
					<li>Added an extra piece of hub music.</li>
					<li>Added a "mute music" option.</li>
					<li>Added "disableMap" and "disableSplitScreen" configs for levels.</li>
					<li>Changed the time to vote for a level from 15 seconds to 20.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Netcode Improvements</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Clients can now communicate directly with one another rather than having to go through the host.</b> This should result in everything being much more stable when playing with more than two players, and also resolves a lot of host advantage. In some cases, this effectively halves the latency.</li>
					<li>Players and NPCs will no longer accept an out-of-order update, which should result in less "jerky" movement.</li>
					<li>Player projectiles such as fireballs, hammers, etc. are now attacker-favoured rather than defender-favoured, making them more fair to avoid.</li>
					<li>NPCs transforming upon being jumped on (e.g., koopas turning into shells) should now work much more reliably.</li>
					<li>Some NPCs (such as the stars in Star Catcher) now use a "fair collection" system which ensures that the correct player gets them.</li>
					<li>Made players standing on moving layers appear more stable.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause NPCs to not spawn.</li>
					<li>Fixed errors and some overall brokeness with lineguided NPCs.</li>
					<li>Fixed bombs becoming stuck and constantly making explosion sounds.</li>
					<li>Players using warps are now better synced.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Fixes</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Fixed a softlock that could occur if someone stops responding before the level select opens.</li>
					<li>Fixed an oversight that caused the more descriptive error messages when trying to join a room to never be displayed in practice.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug that could cause onNPCTransform to not run (especially after being frozen), often resulting in extra settings not being initialised properly.</li>
					<li>Fixed the player's character and costume changing when joining/leaving an online room.</li>
					<li>Fixed the shockwaves of the Stone being able to stun players on the same team and players in statue form.</li>
					<li>Fixed how a player's outline is rendered when using a Boo Mushroom.</li>
					<li>Fixed the player icons on the HUD not displaying correctly in horizontal split screen.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug that caused the HUD to not display correctly in Recon Mode when seamless wrap was enabled.</li>
                </ul>
			</p>

			<h2>v1.1.0 - 2024/09/29</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added team battles. The host can enable and choose teams from the settings menu.</li>
                    <li>Added a "reserve box enabled" option (enabled by default). This gives Mario and Luigi the ability to hold powerups in reserve, as they normally would.</li>
					<li>Added the minPlayers, maxPlayers, unplayableLocally and unplayableOnline configs for levels. These disable the selection of a level if their conditions are not met.</li>
					<li>Added a warning when pausing the game by unfocusing the window during online play.</li>
					<li>Multiple players in the same room can no longer share a color.</li>
					<li>Improved how levels which include a text_english.json file work (there is no longer a risk of this causing forward compatibility issues).</li>
					<li>When spectating another player, that player's coin counter is now visible.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug that could cause an "empty player" to appear after a player had disconnected from the room.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug where, online, the start of another player's jump could look weird if they were playing as Peach or Link.</li>
					<li>Fixed an error with swinging platforms online.</li>
                </ul>
			</p>

			<h2>v1.0.1 - 2024/08/24</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
                    <li>Added a "start with mushroom" option.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that would happen when attempting to press a button that was greyed out.</li>
                    <li>Fixed being able to access the console when playing normally.</li>
                </ul>
			</p>
