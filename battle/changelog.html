			<h1>Changelog</h1>

			<h2>v1.1.0 - 2024/09/29</h2>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>Added team battles. The host can enable and choose teams from the settings menu.</li>
                    <li>Added a "reserve box enabled" option (enabled by default). This gives Mario and Luigi the ability to hold powerups in reserve, as they normally would.</li>
					<li>Added the minPlayers, maxPlayers, unplayableLocally and unplayableOnline configs for levels. These disable the selection of a level if their conditions are not met.</li>
					<li>Added a warning when pausing the game by unfocusing the window during online play.</li>
					<li>Multiple players in the same room can no longer share a color.</li>
					<li>Improved how levels which include a text_english.json file work (there is no longer a risk of this causing forward compatibility issues).</li>
					<li>When spectating another player, that player's coin counter is now visible.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug that could cause an "empty player" to appear after a player had disconnected from the room.</li>
					<li>Fixed a bug where, online, the start of another player's jump could look weird if they were playing as Peach or Link.</li>
                </ul>
			</p>

			<h2>v1.0.1 - 2024/08/24</h2>

				<ul>
                    <li>Added a "start with mushroom" option.</li>
                    <li>Fixed an error that would happen when attempting to press a button that was greyed out.</li>
                    <li>Fixed being able to access the console when playing normally.</li>
                </ul>
			</p>
