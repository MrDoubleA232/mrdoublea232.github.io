			<h2>Timing</h2>
			<p>
				There are two main values used to keep track of the current time. <span class="codeName">onlinePlay.localTime</span> counts the amount of time in seconds since the level started. This value is specific to the user running the game; as such, it would not make sense to send this to other users.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="codeName">onlinePlay.syncedTime</span> is similar to the local time, but it is synced between players and thusly can be used as a timestamp between players. Note that this value may actually decrease in some situations, so you cannot rely on it always counting upwards.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that neither of these serve to replace the lunatime class. Rather, they act as another way of timing things in the case that the real time in seconds is important.
